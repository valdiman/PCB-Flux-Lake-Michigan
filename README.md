This README file describes R code to calculate the air-water flux of total PCB congeners from southern Lake Michigan from air and water active samples from September 2010. It includes a Monte Carlo simulation. Net, absorption and volatilization fluxes can be calculated. (i) For net fluxes, keep both air and water concentrations, (ii) for absoprtion, water concentation should be 0 and (iii) for volatilization, air concentration should be 0. This change can be perform in line 245. The code is written to calcualte per deployment time, thus concentrations and meteorological data need to be selected. The data can be downloaded from PANGAEA (link), using the R package pangaear (https://cran.microsoft.com/snapshot/2022-01-01/web/packages/pangaear/pangaear.pdf).
